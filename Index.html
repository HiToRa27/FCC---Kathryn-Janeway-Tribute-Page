      <p><strong>Kathryn Janeway</strong> was born on May 20, 2336 in Bloomington, Indiana on Earth. She was the
        daughter of Vice Admiral Janeway and has a sister named Phoebe, who is the artist in the family. Phoebe
        never chose to join Starfleet and stayed close to home with her mother, Gretchen Janeway. Kathryn
        Janeway was very close to her father, who taught her to look at the universe with a scientist's eye; she
        was devastated by his death. Her first mission after graduating the academy was as a science officer on
        the USS Al-Batani, where she served as Chief Science Officer during the Arias mission.</p>

      <p>Captain Janeway takes command of the Intrepid-class USS Voyager in 2371. Their first mission is to locate
        and capture a Maquis vessel last seen in the area of space known as the Badlands. While there, the
        Maquis ship and Voyager are transported against their will into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light-years
        away, by a massive displacement wave. The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and
        although Voyager survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect the Ocampa, who live on a
        planet Voyager visits, Janeway destroys the Caretaker Array, the space station that transported the two
        ships to the Delta Quadrant, which provides energy to the Ocampa's planet, despite the fact that the
        Array may be the two ships' only chance to return home. In doing this, Janeway strands her ship and crew
        seven decades' travel from home.</p>

      Her first major task is integrating the surviving Maquis and Voyager crews. Chakotay, captain of the Maquis
      ship, succeeds the deceased Lieutenant Commander Cavit as her first officer. Janeway also grants convicted
      criminal, former Starfleet officer, and accomplished pilot Tom Paris a field commission, and makes him
      Voyager's helmsman.</p>

      <p>Janeway's other interactions with her crew include helping the de-assimilated Borg Seven of Nine reclaim
        her individuality and humanity and advocating for the Doctor's status as a sentient being.</p>

      <p>During the course of the TV series, Voyager has contact with the Q Continuum on three occasions, and
        repeated contact with the Borg. With the intervention of a future/alternate version of herself, Janeway
        leads her crew in using one of the Borg's transwarp conduits to return her ship to Federation space
        after having traveled through the Delta Quadrant for seven years.</p>

      <p>In a cameo in the film Star Trek: Nemesis, now-Admiral Janeway instructs Captain Jean-Luc Picard to
        travel to Romulus at the invitation of the film's antagonist.</p>
